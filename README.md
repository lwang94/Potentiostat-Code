# Potentiostat Code

## Description:
Code used to run the homebuilt potentiostat I designed and built for my 2019 Master's thesis at the University of Toronto.
The code is written in both C++ and Python. C++ is used solely to communicate between the ADC and DAC chips along with Arduino while 
Python is used to run more complex programs such as defining the parameters of a measurement and displaying it as a graph. Please check 
the User Manual for more details as the code heavily relies on knowledge of the potentiostat hardware as well.
